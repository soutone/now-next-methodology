## Post Body

```markdown
Hey folks -- I've been using Claude Code for a few months now and noticed I kept doing the same thing across projects: manually creating a NOW.md file to track current state and a NEXT.md for upcoming tasks.

After setting this up manually a bunch of times, I figured I'd package it up.

**What it is:**
- NOW.md tracks what you're working on right now
- NEXT.md queues what's coming up
- `/next` command to move between tasks

Just two markdown files in your repo. The AI reads them to keep context across sessions, and they evolve with your code in git.

Packaged it here in case it's useful to anyone else: https://github.com/soutone/now-next-methodology

Works with OpenCode too. The `/setup-now-next` command creates both files if you want to try it.

Would love feedback if anyone gives it a shot :)
