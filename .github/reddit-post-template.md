## Post Body

```markdown
I've been using Claude Code/OpenCode for a while and kept losing track of what I was working on between sessions. So I created a simple two-file system that's been working great:

## What is it?

**NOW.md** - Living documentation of current work
- Recent accomplishments
- Current status
- Open challenges
- Quick reference

**NEXT.md** - Prioritized task queue
- Immediate (do next)
- Soon (this week)
- Later (backlog)
- Ideas (maybe someday)

**`/next` command** - Seamlessly transitions to the next task

## Why it works

- **Simple**: Just two markdown files in your repo
- **Context preservation**: AI maintains full project context across sessions
- **Git-tracked**: Your task management evolves with your code
- **Flexible**: Adapts to any project type or workflow

## Get Started

Repository: https://github.com/soutone/now-next-methodology

Includes:
- Setup guides for Claude Code and OpenCode
- Template files
- Customization examples

The `/setup-now-next` command creates both files instantly.

Curious what others think - do you use something similar? What's your approach to maintaining context in AI-assisted development?
