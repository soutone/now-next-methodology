## Current Status

API is feature-complete and production-ready. All core functionality implemented and tested. Docker deployment configured. Comprehensive documentation available.

Ready for production deployment pending infrastructure decisions.

---

## Open Challenges

### Technical
- None blocking - all core features working

### Business/Product
- Decide on hosting platform (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Determine pricing model (free tier, subscription, etc.)
- Plan for scaling strategy if user base grows

---

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Choose hosting platform
   - Set up production database
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates
   - Deploy Docker containers

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Add application logging (structured logs)
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry or similar)
   - Create dashboards for key metrics
   - Configure alerts for downtime

3. **Additional Features** (Post-MVP)
   - Wallet address tracking (not just exchanges)
   - Email notifications for significant price changes
   - Tax reporting / capital gains calculations
   - Mobile app for portfolio monitoring

## Architecture Notes

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Exchange abstraction layer** - Enables easy addition of new exchanges
- **Redis for caching** - Reduces external API calls, improves performance
- **JWT auth** - Stateless, scales horizontally
- **Docker deployment** - Consistent environments, easy scaling

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for exchange APIs
- API endpoint tests for all routes
- Current coverage: 78%
