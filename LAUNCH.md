- Contributors
- Clones/traffic

### Qualitative
- User testimonials
- Feature requests (indicates engagement)
- Community examples shared
- Integration requests (indicates adoption)

## Risk Mitigation

### If Launch Flops
- Not everyone will find this useful - that's OK
- Core value: **you** still benefit from using it
- Learning: Experience open-sourcing and marketing
- Fallback: Keep using it privately, iterate based on your needs

### If It Gets Popular
- Set boundaries: Label as "maintained" vs "actively developed"
- Defer complex features to community contributions
- Focus on keeping core simple, additions as plugins
- Don't let maintenance become a burden

## Timeline

**Week 1:** Soft launch in Discord, gather feedback
**Week 2:** Submit to awesome lists, Twitter thread
**Week 3:** HN/Reddit posts, Dev.to article
**Week 4+:** Ongoing content, community engagement
