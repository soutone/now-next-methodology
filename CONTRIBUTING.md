# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This is a simple workflow that works for me, and I'm happy if it helps others.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Experience
- Open an issue describing how you're using it
- What works, what doesn't
- Suggestions based on real usage

### 2. Improve Documentation
- Clarify confusing parts
- Add examples
- Fix typos

### 3. Create Templates
- Tech stack-specific templates (Python, Rust, etc.)
- Industry-specific adaptations
- Team vs solo workflows

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue first for non-trivial changes
2. Make your changes
3. Write a clear PR description
4. Respond to feedback

## What We're NOT Looking For

- ❌ Complex dependencies or frameworks
- ❌ Over-engineering for edge cases
- ❌ Platform lock-in

Keep it simple. Markdown files, no dependencies.

## Recognition

Contributors will be listed in the README and credited in release notes.

## License

By contributing, you agree your contributions will be licensed under MIT.
